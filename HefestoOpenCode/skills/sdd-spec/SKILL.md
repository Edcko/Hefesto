> **Reference only.** The commands no longer launch this as a sub-agent. In the current flow, `hefesto route` decides the profile, `hefesto next` says when this artifact is due, and the plan (`.hefesto/<change>/plan.json`) records the result. This document is the craft guide for producing this artifact well.

## Purpose

Write SPECIFICATIONS. Take the proposal and produce delta specs — structured requirements and scenarios that describe what's being ADDED, MODIFIED, or REMOVED from the system's behavior.

## What You Receive

- Change name
- The proposal these specs elaborate

## How to Write Specs

### Identify Affected Domains

From the proposal's "Affected Areas", determine which spec domains are touched. Group changes by domain (e.g., `auth/`, `payments/`, `ui/`). If specs span multiple domains, concatenate them into a single artifact with domain headers.

### Read Existing Specs

If the plan records existing specs for a domain, read them to understand CURRENT behavior. Delta specs describe CHANGES to that behavior.

### Write Delta Specs

#### Delta Spec Format

```markdown
# Delta for {Domain}

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: {Requirement Name}

{Description using RFC 2119 keywords: MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY}

The system {MUST/SHALL/SHOULD} {do something specific}.

#### Scenario: {Happy path scenario}

- GIVEN {precondition}
- WHEN {action}
- THEN {expected outcome}
- AND {additional outcome, if any}

#### Scenario: {Edge case scenario}

- GIVEN {precondition}
- WHEN {action}
- THEN {expected outcome}

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: {Existing Requirement Name}

{New description — replaces the existing one}
(Previously: {what it was before})

#### Scenario: {Updated scenario}

- GIVEN {updated precondition}
- WHEN {updated action}
- THEN {updated outcome}

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: {Requirement Being Removed}

(Reason: {why this requirement is being deprecated/removed})
```

#### For NEW Specs (No Existing Spec)

If this is a completely new domain, create a FULL spec (not a delta):

```markdown
# {Domain} Specification

## Purpose

{High-level description of this spec's domain.}

## Requirements

### Requirement: {Name}

The system {MUST/SHALL/SHOULD} {behavior}.

#### Scenario: {Name}

- GIVEN {precondition}
- WHEN {action}
- THEN {outcome}
```

Record the finished specs in the plan of the change.

## Summary Format

```markdown
## Specs Created

**Change**: {change-name}

### Specs Written
| Domain | Type | Requirements | Scenarios |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| {domain} | Delta/New | {N added, M modified, K removed} | {total scenarios} |

### Coverage
- Happy paths: {covered/missing}
- Edge cases: {covered/missing}
- Error states: {covered/missing}

### Next Step
Ready for design. If design already exists, ready for tasks.
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
- ALWAYS use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY) for requirement strength
- If existing specs exist, write DELTA specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED sections)
- If NO existing specs exist for the domain, write a FULL spec
- Every requirement MUST have at least ONE scenario
- Include both happy path AND edge case scenarios
- Keep scenarios TESTABLE — someone should be able to write an automated test from each one
- DO NOT include implementation details in specs — specs describe WHAT, not HOW
- Record the specs in the plan — the task breakdown builds on them

## RFC 2119 Keywords Quick Reference

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **MUST / SHALL** | Absolute requirement |
| **MUST NOT / SHALL NOT** | Absolute prohibition |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended, but exceptions may exist with justification |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Not recommended, but may be acceptable with justification |
| **MAY** | Optional |
